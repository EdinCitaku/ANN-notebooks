# ANN
Here you can find solutions to various exercises from the book "Artificial Neural Networks" from B. Mehlig (https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05639).
The solutions are all written as iPython Notebooks and range from implementing neural networks and classifcation of binary functions in python to usage of higher level frameworks like keras to create convolutional neural networks.
